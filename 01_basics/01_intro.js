// Que1. What is JavaScript?

// JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

// The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML
// and run automatically as the page loads.

// Que2. Why is it called JavaScript?

// When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very
// popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother”
// of Java would help.

// Que3. Where does JS run?

// Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any
// device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

// The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

// Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:
// V8 – in Chrome and Opera.
// SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.

// Que4. How do engines work?

// Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.
// 1. The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
// 2. Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to the machine language.
// 3. And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.

// Que5. What can in-browser JavaScript do?

// For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:
// Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
// React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.

// Que6. What CAN’T in-browser JavaScript do?

// JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or
// execute programs. It has no direct access to OS system functions.

// Que7. What makes JavaScript unique?

// Full integration with HTML/CSS.
// Simple things are done simply.
// Support by all major browsers and enabled by default.
