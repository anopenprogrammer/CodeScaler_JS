<!-- DOM Introduction -->

<!-- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
The DOM provides a way to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page. -->

<!-- The DOM represents a document as a tree of nodes.
Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML document is a node.
The relationships between nodes (parent, child, sibling) reflect the structure of the HTML document. -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
